This error occurs when using AsyncStorage in React Native and you try to access the stored data before it has been fully retrieved.  It's often masked by the asynchronous nature of AsyncStorage.

```javascript
// Incorrect usage
AsyncStorage.getItem('myKey').then(value => {
  console.log(value); // value might be undefined here if getItem hasn't finished
  // ...use value...
});

// ...other code that might execute before the above .then block...
```

The problem is that the code after `AsyncStorage.getItem` might execute *before* the asynchronous operation completes, leading to `value` being `undefined` or `null` resulting in unexpected crashes or incorrect behavior.
